# The Partition Problem

This is the code that goes with this [blog post](http://blog.jpalardy.com/posts/the-partition-problem/).

The R code is meant to be run interactively, either in RStudio or with
something like [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime).

The Minizinc subdirectory contains a Makefile that shows how to run that code.
